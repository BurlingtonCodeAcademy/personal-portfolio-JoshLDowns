          Well... I officially have two weeks of the Web Development bootcamp in
          the books, and I gotta say, I I'm pumped. The class is still in review
          mode, and I've spent a lot of time working on my Text Adventure (NPM
          package coming soon!) while we have gone over material in class. I've
          been able to work on my skills as a teacher though, as I've spent a
          good deal of time helping the class out. It even looks like I'm going
          to get to TA the upcoming part time class, which I'm really excited
          about.

        <p className="code-text">
          Now when I said I spent most of my week working on my text adventure,
          that might have been a slight exaggeration... I spent the entire week
          working on it, basically whenever I could. During the part time
          course, we got assigned this project called Zorkington, where we had
          to make a small text based adventure (like Zork) based in Burlington.
          I asked if I could go off on my own route, and make a game of my own
          design. Thankfully, that was totally within fine with my professor
          (Bob... he's the man), and I began excitedly plugging away at what
          would soon become a small obsession. After some light storyboarding,
          map drawing, and writing... Robot Apocalypse was born. The game I
          turned in for that project was ok, but nowhere near what I had
          envisioned. After the part time class ended, I spent quite a bit of
          time tinkering with the game, and using it as an excuse to learn new
          things.
        </p>
        <p className="code-text">
          Fast forward to about a week and a half ago when I find out that I can
          continue working on that project, and turn it in for the same project
          in the Full Time boot camp I'm currently enrolled in. I'm beyond
          excited to keep working on the game, and dive even deeper into
          javascript libraries I hadn't worked with before. I find new bugs,
          learn more about node.js in order to figure them out, find new bugs
          again, learn more again... the cycle has been incredible. I never
          thought running full boar into a wall I knew was coming could be so
          much fun, but that's what coding is all about. Every couple steps
          forward, there is a step back (sometimes more). I've learned to
          instead of letting that get me down, to embrace it. It's part of the
          learning experience, and it's a part that will never go away.

          I think I'll end this one here, since it feels like I've hit a life
          lesson of sorts. I've had a hard time in the past with self worth, and
          feeling like a failure. Coding has really helped me understand that
          shortcomings and pitfalls are just part of the journey.
